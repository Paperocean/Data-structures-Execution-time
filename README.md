# Data Structures - Execution Time Analysis
This repository contains a collection of C++ programs designed to analyze and compare the execution time of various data structures. The project focuses on measuring and benchmarking the performance of operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal across different data structures.

## Key Features
- **Data Structures Covered**: The project includes implementations of several common data structures such as:

  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Queues
  - Binary Search Trees
  - Hash Tables
  - Heaps

- **Performance Analysis**: Each data structure is tested with varying input sizes to evaluate the time complexity of its key operations.

- **Execution Time Measurement**: The programs utilize time tracking mechanisms to record the duration of each operation, providing detailed insights into the efficiency of each data structure.

Comparison of Data Structures: Results from the tests are compared to understand which data structure performs best under specific conditions, helping users select the right one based on their needs.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Paperocean/Data-structures-Execution-time.git
cd Data-structures-Execution-time
```
2. Compile and run the programs using a C++ compiler, such as g++:
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```
3. Modify input sizes in the source code to run custom tests and observe the changes in execution time.
